[h1]I found a bug that's not covered above, what to do now?[/h1]
First of all, you should try to reproduce the bug with only this mod enabled and write the steps necessary to reproduce the bug. If you can't reproduce it with only this mod then try to limit it to a specif set of mods. Check your logs for errors and post them with any other relevant information.
